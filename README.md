- [X] Data loading into dataset
- [X] Continuously self-play games with specific model
- [X] Save self-play data on disk
- [ ] Fix training (loss doesn't drop, maybe loss calculation is wrong?)
- [ ] Qt GUI for self-play
- [ ] Human vs computer (with GUI)
- [ ] Multithreaded MCTS
- [ ] Parallel self-play
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster of self-play clients
